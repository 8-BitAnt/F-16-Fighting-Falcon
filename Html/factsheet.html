<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080"><b>Mission</b><br>
The F-16 Fighting
Falcon is a compact, multi-role fighter aircraft. It is highly maneuverable and
has proven itself in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. It provides a
relatively low-cost, high-performance weapon system for the United States and
allied nations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080"><b>Features</b><br>
In an air combat
role, the F-16's maneuverability and combat radius (distance it can fly to enter
air combat, stay, fight and return) exceed that of all potential threat fighter
aircraft. It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low flying
aircraft in radar ground clutter. In an air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly
more than 500 miles (860 kilometers), deliver its weapons with superior
accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting
point. An all-weather capability allows it to accurately deliver ordnance during
non-visual bombing conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">In designing the
F-16, advanced aerospace science and proven reliable systems from other aircraft
such as the F-15 and F-111 were selected. These were combined to simplify the
airplane and reduce its size, purchase price, maintenance costs and weight. The
light weight of the fuselage is achieved without reducing its strength. With a
full load of internal fuel, the F-16 can withstand up to nine G's -- nine times
the force of gravity -- which exceeds the capability of other current fighter
aircraft.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">The cockpit and its
bubble canopy give the pilot unobstructed forward and upward vision, and greatly
improved vision over the side and to the rear. The seat-back angle was expanded
from the usual 13 degrees to 30 degrees, increasing pilot comfort and gravity
force tolerance. The pilot has excellent flight control of the F-16 through its
&quot;fly-by-wire&quot; system. Electrical wires relay commands, replacing the
usual cables and linkage controls. For easy and accurate control of the aircraft
during high G-force combat maneuvers, a side stick controller is used instead of
the conventional center-mounted stick. Hand pressure on the side stick
controller sends electrical signals to actuators of flight control surfaces such
as ailerons and rudder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">Avionics systems
include a highly accurate inertial navigation system in which a computer
provides steering information to the pilot. The plane has UHF and VHF radios
plus an instrument landing system. It also has a warning system and modular
countermeasure pods to be used against airborne or surface electronic threats.
The fuselage has space for additional avionics systems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080"><b>Background</b><br>
The F-16A, a
single-seat model, first flew in December 1976. The first operational F-16A was
delivered in January 1979 to the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force
Base, Utah.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">The F-16B, a
two-seat model, has tandem cockpits that are about the same size as the one in
the A model. Its bubble canopy extends to cover the second cockpit. To make room
for the second cockpit, the forward fuselage fuel tank and avionics growth space
were reduced. During training, the forward cockpit is used by a student pilot
with an instructor pilot in the rear cockpit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">All F-16s delivered
since November 1981 have built-in structural and wiring provisions and systems
architecture that permit expansion of the multi-role flexibility to perform
precision strike, night attack and beyond-visual-range interception missions.
This improvement program led to the F-16C and F-16D aircraft, which are the
single- and two-place counterparts to the F-16A/B, and incorporate the latest
cockpit control and display technology. All active units and many Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve units have converted to the F-16C/D.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">The F-16 was built
under an unusual agreement creating a consortium between the United States and
four NATO countries: Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. These
countries jointly produced with the United States an initial 348 F-16s for their
air forces. Final airframe assembly lines were located in Belgium and the
Netherlands. The consortium's F-16s are assembled from components manufactured
in all five countries. Belgium also provides final assembly of the F100 engine
used in the European F-16s. Recently, Portugal joined the consortium. The
long-term benefits of this program will be technology transfer among the nations
producing the F-16, and a common-use aircraft for NATO nations. This program
increases the supply and availability of repair parts in Europe and improves the
F-16's combat readiness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">USAF F-16
multi-mission fighters were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of
Operation Desert Storm, where more sorties were flown than with any other
aircraft. These fighters were used to attack airfields, military production
facilities, Scud missiles sites and a variety of other targets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">Most recently in
the Spring of 1999 during Operation Allied Force, USAF F-16 multi-mission
fighters flew a variety of missions to include suppression of enemy air defense,
offensive counter air, defensive counter air, close air support and forward air
controller missions. Mission results were outstanding as these fighters
destroyed radar sites, vehicles, tanks, MiGs and buildings.</font></p>
